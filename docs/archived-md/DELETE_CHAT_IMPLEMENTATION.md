# Delete Chat Feature - Implementation

## Overview
Fully implemented chat deletion functionality that was previously a placeholder.

## What Was Wrong
- Clicking delete chat showed: "Chat deletion will be re-enabled soon"
- No actual deletion occurred
- Just a placeholder toast message

## What's Fixed

### 1. Server Function (`src/lib/chat-actions.ts`)
Added `deleteChatSession()` function:
- Verifies chat belongs to the user (security)
- Deletes all messages in the chat
- Deletes the chat session itself
- Returns success/error status
- Uses authenticated Supabase client

### 2. API Endpoint (`src/app/api/chat/delete/route.ts`)
New DELETE endpoint at `/api/chat/delete`:
- Edge runtime compatible
- Takes `chatId`, `userId`, and optional `accessToken`
- Calls `deleteChatSession()` server function
- Returns proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling

### 3. Client Implementation (`src/app/chat/page.tsx`)
Updated handlers:
- `handleDeleteChat()` - Shows confirmation dialog
- `confirmDeleteChat()` - Executes deletion via API
- Redirects to new chat if deleting active chat
- Refreshes chat history automatically
- Shows success/error toasts

### 4. UI Flow
1. User clicks trash icon on chat in sidebar
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Are you sure?"
3. User clicks "Continue"
4. API call deletes chat + messages from database
5. If deleted chat was active → redirect to new chat
6. Chat history refreshes to show updated list
7. Success toast: "Chat Deleted"

## Security
- User ID verification ensures users can only delete their own chats
- Server-side validation before deletion
- Proper authentication token handling

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ API endpoint created successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production
2. Test delete functionality with real chat data
3. Verify chat history updates correctly
4. Test edge cases (deleting active chat, last chat, etc.)
