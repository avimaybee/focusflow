App Name: FocusFlow AI
Vision & Core Philosophy: The AI Study Partner
FocusFlow AI transforms the traditional study experience by offering a conversational, chat-first interface, where AI is not just a tool, but an intelligent, adaptive study partner. All core functionalities are seamlessly integrated into a single, intuitive chat window, allowing students to interact, create, plan, and track their learning progress without breaking their flow. Our goal is to provide instant clarity, personalized guidance, and engaging learning experiences, making studying feel controlled, rewarding, and even enjoyable.
