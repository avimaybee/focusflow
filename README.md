# FocusFlow AI: Project Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the FocusFlow AI application, detailing its features, technical implementation, design philosophy, and key development challenges.

## 1. Application Vision & UI/UX Philosophy

FocusFlow AI is an intelligent, all-in-one study toolkit designed to be a student's proactive co-pilot. The core vision is to deliver sophisticated AI-powered assistance through a simple, intuitive, and delightful interface.

### UI/UX Goals:
- **Effortless Intelligence:** AI interactions feel natural and predictive, not cumbersome.
- **Intuitive Harmony:** The interface is clean, with ample whitespace, consistent components, and a clear visual hierarchy, ensuring every interaction is intentional.
- **Minimalist Design:** Built with **ShadCN UI** and **Tailwind CSS**, the app features a professional dark theme (`#1B1F23`), a primary blue accent (`#3B82F6`), and refined typography (Satoshi for headings, Inter for body text).
- **Subtle Delight:** Micro-animations using **Framer Motion** are employed for smooth transitions, component reveals (like the Smart Tools menu), and interactive elements to create a satisfying user experience.

## 2. Core Features

### a. Conversational AI Chat
The central feature is a dynamic chat interface where users interact with an AI study assistant. It supports text input and file uploads (PDF, images, text) to provide context for conversations.

### b. Customizable AI Personas
Users can select from a variety of AI personas (e.g., *Explain Like I'm 5*, *Brutally Honest Mentor*, *Cram Buddy*) to tailor the AI's tone and teaching style to their specific learning needs.

### c. Integrated Study Tools
- **Flashcard & Quiz Generation:** From any AI response or user-provided text, users can instantly generate interactive, flippable flashcards and multiple-choice quizzes directly within the chat interface. These are core, first-class features.
- **Smart Text Utilities:** A context-aware toolbar appears under AI messages, offering tools to `Rewrite Text`, `Convert to Bullets`, `Find Counterarguments`, and `Create a Presentation Outline`.

### d. Prompt Template Library
A rich library of pre-made prompts helps users kickstart complex tasks like creating study plans, proofreading text, or brainstorming essay ideas.

### e. User Dashboard & Gamification
A personalized dashboard tracks user activity and progress.
- **KPIs:** Displays counts of summaries, quizzes, and flashcards created.
- **Progress Tracking:** A chart visualizes weekly study sessions against user-set goals.
- **Gamification:** Features a "Study Streak" counter and unlockable badges to motivate consistent learning.

### f. Authentication & Content Persistence
- **Secure Authentication:** Supports Email/Password and Google Sign-In via **Firebase Authentication**.
- **Personalized Content:** Logged-in users have their generated summaries, quizzes, flashcard sets, and study plans automatically saved to their personal "My Content" area, powered by **Firestore**.

## 3. Technical Implementation & Flow

### a. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Framer Motion
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Functions)
- **AI:** Google Genkit, Google Gemini Models (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro` for complex tasks, `gemini-1.5-flash` for conversational routing)

### b. Core Chat Flow
1.  **User Input:** The user sends a message or selects a tool from the `ChatPage` UI.
2.  **API Route:** A request is made to the `/api/chat` Next.js server route, containing the message, user auth token, and any contextual data (like a file's data URI or a selected persona).
3.  **Genkit Flow (`chatFlow`):** The API route invokes the main Genkit flow (`src/ai/flows/chat-flow.ts`).
4.  **Tool Dispatch:** The flow, powered by a Gemini model, determines user intent. It either formulates a direct conversational response or calls a specific, predefined **Genkit Tool** (e.g., `createQuizTool`, `summarizeNotesTool`).
5.  **Structured Output:** Tools are designed to return structured JSON data (e.g., an array of flashcard objects, a quiz object with questions and answers).
6.  **Data Persistence:** If a tool was used, the `chatFlow` saves the generated content to the user's Firestore `My Content` subcollection (e.g., `/users/{userId}/quizzes/{quizId}`).
7.  **Response to Client:** The flow returns a response object containing the AI's text and any structured data (like the quiz object).
8.  **Frontend Rendering:** The `ChatPage` receives the response. If structured data is present, it renders the corresponding interactive component (`QuizViewer`, `FlashcardViewer`); otherwise, it displays the formatted text response.

## 4. Key Development Challenge & Resolution

The project's most significant hurdle was a persistent `500 Internal Server Error` during early development of the chat feature. This critical bug blocked all AI interactions and stemmed from an incompatibility with the (now deprecated) **Genkit Beta Chat Session API**.

### The Problem:
The bug was traced to the `FirestoreSessionStore`, which was responsible for saving and loading conversation history for Genkit's session management. The root causes were:
1.  **Timestamp Mismatch:** Firestore stores dates as a proprietary `Timestamp` object, but the Genkit library expected standard JavaScript `Date` objects. The session store was not converting these types correctly upon loading, corrupting the history data.
2.  **History Structure Inconsistency:** The structure of the `history` array required by the Genkit model adapter was extremely specific. Minor deviations in the saved format caused a `TypeError`, leading to the server crash.

### The Solution:
The issue was resolved by moving away from the problematic automated session management and implementing a more direct and robust state management strategy.
1.  **Refined `FirestoreSessionStore`:** The class was rewritten to be more robust, with recursive helper functions to reliably convert `Timestamp` objects to `Date` objects when loading data, and vice-versa when saving.
2.  **Stabilized Client-Side Rendering:** The chat page (`src/app/chat/page.tsx`) was updated to correctly read the chat history directly from the session document in Firestore, ensuring messages and their associated data are rendered reliably.
3.  **Explicit Data Flow:** The `chatFlow` was made more explicit. Instead of relying on automatic history, it now manually processes tool outputs and includes structured data directly in its return object, which the client can then parse and render.

This solution completely stabilized the chat feature, making it the robust and functional core of the application it is today.
