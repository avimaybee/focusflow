// Creating an array of fruits

// Accessing items (counting starts at 0!)
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: ''apple''
console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: ''banana''

// Adding a new fruit
fruits.push(''grape'');
```

**Breaking it down**:
- `const fruits = [...]` creates our list
- `[0]` gets the FIRST item (zero-based counting)
- `.push()` adds to the end

**Common Mistake**: Forgetting arrays start at 0, not 1!

**Try This**: Create an array of your 3 favorite colors and log the second one."
