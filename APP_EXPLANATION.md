## 1. Core Architecture & Philosophy

- **Technology Stack**:
  - **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 18, TypeScript.
  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components for a robust, themeable design system.
  - **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, delightful micro-interactions.
  - **AI & Backend**: Google Genkit orchestrating Gemini models for all AI-powered features.
  - **Database**: Firestore (Firebase) for all user data, including profiles, chat history, and saved content.
  - **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-in (Email/Password & Google).

- **UI/UX Philosophy**:
  - **Theme**: A professional, dark theme with a deep charcoal background (`hsl(224, 10%, 10%)`), a vibrant blue primary color (`hsl(217, 91%, 60%)`), and a muted purple accent.
  - **Typography**: "Poppins" for headings and "PT Sans" for body text to create a clean, modern visual hierarchy.
  - **Layout**: A consistent layout with a global Header and Footer for most pages, while the core Chat experience utilizes a dedicated, full-screen layout. The landing page features a dynamic, full-page `Spotlight` and `BackgroundLines` effect for an immersive feel.

## 2. Page-by-Page Breakdown

### a. Landing Page (`/`)

- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To attract new users by showcasing the app's primary features and value propositions.
- **Structure**:
  - **Hero Section**: An engaging introduction with an animated headline (`FlipHeading`), a clear value proposition with a `TextFlip` component for dynamic keywords, and a prominent "Get Started for Free" call-to-action button.
  - **Background Effects**: The entire page is wrapped in a `Spotlight` component that creates a light-from-cursor effect and `BackgroundLines` that provide a subtle, animated backdrop across all sections.
  - **Features Section**: A "Bento Grid" layout using `GlowingCard` components that light up on hover, highlighting key features like AI Chat, customizable personas, and study material generation.

  - **FAQ Section**: An `Accordion` component that neatly organizes and answers common user questions, reducing friction for potential sign-ups.

### b. Chat Page (`/chat` and `/chat/[chatId]`)

- **File**: `src/app/chat/page.tsx` (handles both new and existing chats)
- **Purpose**: The core of the application where all user-AI interaction happens. It is a full-screen, single-page application experience.
- **Structure**:
  - **Chat Sidebar (Left)**:
    - **Component**: `src/components/chat/chat-sidebar.tsx`
    - **Features**:
      - A "New Chat" button to start a fresh conversation.
      - A scrollable list of the user's past chat sessions, fetched by the `useChatHistory` hook. The active chat is highlighted.
      - A user menu at the bottom, showing the user's avatar, name, and plan status (Free/Premium). This menu provides links to the Dashboard and a Logout button.
      - The sidebar is collapsible to maximize screen real-estate, with a clean show/hide animation.
  - **Main Chat Area (Center)**:
    - **Welcome Screen**: For new chats, a `WelcomeScreen` component displays prompt suggestions to help users get started.
    - **Message List**: A scrollable area (`MessageList`) that renders the conversation history. User and AI messages are styled distinctly for clarity.
    - **Interactive AI Messages**: Each AI message (`ChatMessage`) has on-hover tools:
        - **Copy**: Copies the message text.
        - **Save**: Saves the message to "My Content".
        - **Regenerate**: Asks the AI to generate a new response.
        - **Quick Tools**: Buttons to instantly generate flashcards or a quiz from the message content.
        - **Smart Tools Menu**: A pop-out menu with advanced actions like "Rewrite Text," "Find Counterarguments," and "Create Presentation Outline."

      - A prompt library (`PromptLibrary`) for using pre-made templates.
      - An AI persona selector popover (`usePersonaManager`).
      - A file attachment button for providing context (PDFs, images).
      - A "Send" button.
  - **Notes Sidebar (Right)**:
    - **Component**: `src/components/notes/notes-sidebar.tsx`
    - **Functionality**: A slide-out panel toggled from the chat header. It allows users to take notes without leaving the chat. Notes are auto-saved to Firestore using a debounced server action (`saveNotes`).
    - **Text Selection Menu**: A context menu (`TextSelectionMenu`) appears when a user highlights text in an AI response, allowing them to "Explain" the concept or send it directly to their notes.

### c. My Content Page (`/my-content`)

- **File**: `src/app/my-content/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: A central hub for users to view, manage, and share all the content they've generated with the AI.
- **Structure**:
  - **Tabs**: A tabbed interface (`ExpandedTabs`) allows users to filter content by type (All, Summaries, Quizzes, Flashcards, etc.).
  - **Content Grid**: A responsive grid of `Card` components, where each card represents a piece of saved content.
  - **Card Actions**: Each card includes buttons to "View & Edit," "Share Publicly" (or copy link if already public), and "Delete."
  - **Publish as Blog**: For summaries and saved messages, a "Publish as Blog" button opens a modal (`PublishAsBlogModal`) where the user can edit SEO details and publish the content to the public blog.

### d. Content Detail Pages (`/my-content/...`)

- **Files**:
  - `summaries/[summaryId]/page.tsx`
  - `quizzes/[quizId]/page.tsx`

  - `savedMessages/[messageId]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To display and interact with a single piece of saved content.
- **Features**:
  - Each page fetches its specific content from Firestore.
  - A reusable `BackButton` component allows for easy navigation to the main "My Content" page.
  - **Summaries/Saved Messages**: Feature an "Edit" mode that allows users to modify the title and content directly in the browser. Changes are saved back to Firestore via the `updateContent` server action.
  - **Quizzes**: Render an interactive `QuizViewer` component.
  - **Flashcards**: Render an interactive `FlashcardViewer` component.

### e. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To provide users with a personalized overview of their activity and progress, incorporating gamification elements.
- **Structure**:
  - **KPI Cards**: A row of cards at the top displaying key metrics like "Summaries Made" and "Quizzes Taken," using an `AnimatedNumber` component for effect.
  - **Study Streak Card**: A dedicated card that visualizes the user's current study streak with a glowing flame icon that changes color based on streak length.
  - **Weekly Progress Chart**: A bar chart (`Recharts`) that visualizes the user's logged study hours against their weekly goal.

    - A component for setting or updating a weekly study goal.
    - A button to open a dialog for logging a new study session.
  - **Badges Section**: A grid displaying all available achievement badges. Earned badges are highlighted, while unearned ones are greyed out, encouraging further engagement.

### f. Public Content & Blog Pages

- **Files**:
  - `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `/summaries/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `/quizzes/[slug]/page.tsx`, etc.
- **Purpose**: These pages are publicly accessible and crucial for SEO. They render user-generated content that has been explicitly shared.
- **Features**:
  - **Dynamic Metadata**: Each page uses Next.js's `generateMetadata` function to create dynamic `<title>` and `<meta>` tags based on the content's title and description.
  - **Structured Data (JSON-LD)**: Each page includes a `<script>` tag with structured data (e.g., `Article`, `Quiz`, `HowTo`) to help search engines understand the content.
  - **Sitemap**: The `sitemap.ts` file is automatically updated to include all public content URLs, ensuring they are indexed by search engines.

This comprehensive structure ensures a scalable, feature-rich, and user-friendly application.
