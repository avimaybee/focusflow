## 2. Page-by-Page Breakdown

### a. Landing Page (`/`)

- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To attract new users by showcasing the app's primary features and value propositions.
- **Structure**:
  - **Hero Section**: An engaging introduction with an animated headline (`FlipHeading`), a clear value proposition, and a prominent "Get Started for Free" call-to-action button. It features a stylized, non-interactive `AppPreview` component to give users a glimpse of the chat interface.
  - **Features Section**: A "Bento Grid" layout using `GlowingCard` components that light up on hover, highlighting key features like AI Chat, customizable personas, and study material generation.
  - **Testimonials Section**: An auto-playing `Carousel` displaying positive feedback from fictional users, building social proof and trust.
  - **FAQ Section**: An `Accordion` component that neatly organizes and answers common user questions, reducing friction for potential sign-ups.

### b. Chat Page (`/chat` and `/chat/[chatId]`)

- **File**: `src/app/chat/page.tsx` (handles both new and existing chats)
- **Purpose**: The core of the application where all user-AI interaction happens. It is a full-screen, single-page application experience.
- **Structure**:
  - **Chat Sidebar (Left)**:
    - **Component**: `src/components/chat/chat-sidebar.tsx`
    - **Features**:
      - A "New Chat" button to start a fresh conversation.
      - A scrollable list of the user's past chat sessions, fetched by the `useChatHistory` hook. The active chat is highlighted.
      - A user menu at the bottom, showing the user's avatar, name, and plan status (Free/Premium). This menu provides links to the Dashboard and a Logout button.
      - The sidebar is collapsible to maximize screen real-estate.
  - **Main Chat Area (Center)**:
    - **Welcome Screen**: For new chats, a `WelcomeScreen` component displays prompt suggestions to help users get started.
    - **Message List**: A scrollable area (`MessageList`) that renders the conversation history. User and AI messages are styled distinctly for clarity. AI messages include interactive elements like a "Copy" button and a "Smart Tools" menu for follow-up actions (e.g., create flashcards, summarize).
    - **Chat Input**: A sophisticated `ChatInputArea` at the bottom, which includes:
      - A prompt library (`PromptLibrary`) for using pre-made templates.
      - An AI persona selector popover (`usePersonaManager`).
      - A file attachment button for providing context (PDFs, images).
      - A "Send" button.
  - **Notes Sidebar (Right)**:
    - **Component**: `src/components/notes/notes-sidebar.tsx`
    - **Functionality**: A slide-out panel toggled from the chat header. It allows users to take notes without leaving the chat. Notes are auto-saved to Firestore using a debounced server action (`saveNotes`).
    - **Text Selection Menu**: A context menu (`TextSelectionMenu`) appears when a user highlights text in an AI response, allowing them to "Explain" the concept or send it directly to their notes.

### c. My Content Page (`/my-content`)

- **File**: `src/app/my-content/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: A central hub for users to view, manage, and share all the content they've generated with the AI.
- **Structure**:
  - **Tabs**: A tabbed interface (`ExpandedTabs`) allows users to filter content by type (All, Summaries, Quizzes, Flashcards, etc.).
  - **Content Grid**: A responsive grid of `Card` components, where each card represents a piece of saved content.
  - **Card Actions**: Each card includes buttons to "View & Edit," "Share Publicly," and "Delete."
  - **Publish as Blog**: For summaries and saved messages, a "Publish as Blog" button opens a modal (`PublishAsBlogModal`) where the user can edit SEO details and publish the content to the public blog.

### d. Content Detail Pages (`/my-content/...`)

- **Files**:
  - `summaries/[summaryId]/page.tsx`
  - `quizzes/[quizId]/page.tsx`
  - `flashcardSets/[flashcardSetId]/page.tsx`
  - `savedMessages/[messageId]/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To display and interact with a single piece of saved content.
- **Features**:
  - Each page fetches its specific content from Firestore.
  - A "Back" button allows for easy navigation to the main "My Content" page.
  - **Summaries/Saved Messages**: Feature an "Edit" mode that allows users to modify the title and content directly in the browser. Changes are saved back to Firestore via the `updateContent` server action.
  - **Quizzes**: Render an interactive `QuizViewer` component.
  - **Flashcards**: Render an interactive `FlashcardViewer` component.

### e. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

- **File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: To provide users with a personalized overview of their activity and progress, incorporating gamification elements.
- **Structure**:
  - **KPI Cards**: A row of cards at the top displaying key metrics like "Current Streak," "Summaries Made," and "Quizzes Taken."
  - **Weekly Progress Chart**: A bar chart (`Recharts`) that visualizes the user's logged study hours against their weekly goal.
  - **Actions & Stats Panel**:
    - A component for setting or updating a weekly study goal.
    - A button to open a dialog for logging a new study session.
  - **Badges Section**: A grid displaying all available achievement badges. Earned badges are highlighted, while unearned ones are greyed out, encouraging further engagement.

### f. Public Content & Blog Pages

- **Files**:
  - `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `/summaries/[slug]/page.tsx`
  - `/quizzes/[slug]/page.tsx`, etc.
- **Purpose**: These pages are publicly accessible and crucial for SEO. They render user-generated content that has been explicitly shared.
- **Features**:
  - **Dynamic Metadata**: Each page uses Next.js's `generateMetadata` function to create dynamic `<title>` and `<meta>` tags based on the content's title and description.
  - **Structured Data (JSON-LD)**: Each page includes a `<script>` tag with structured data (e.g., `Article`, `Quiz`, `HowTo`) to help search engines understand the content.
  - **Sitemap**: The `sitemap.ts` file is automatically updated to include all public content URLs, ensuring they are indexed by search engines.

This comprehensive structure ensures a scalable, feature-rich, and user-friendly application.
