FocusFlow AI: The Conversational AI Study Partner
1. Executive Summary & Core Aim
FocusFlow AI is a modern, full-stack web application designed as an intelligent "co-pilot" for students. It fundamentally solves the problem of academic overload and disorganization by replacing fragmented study tools with a unified, conversational interface.
Core Aim (Project Identification): To build a highly scalable, polished, and intuitive AI-powered platform that seamlessly integrates note processing, study planning, and progress tracking, transforming the user experience into a delightful, fluid collaboration with an intelligent assistant.
Core Vision: To achieve Effortless Intelligence and Intuitive Harmony in design, where every interaction reinforces the user's sense of clarity, control, and mastery over their academic tasks.
2. Technical Architecture & Stack
The application utilizes a highly decoupled, modern, and cost-effective serverless architecture.
Component	Technology	Rationale
Frontend/Framework	TypeScript, Next.js (App Router)	Type safety, performance, SEO-friendly architecture (Server Components/Actions).
Styling/UI Kit	Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI	Utility-first styling for rapid, consistent development. Composable, accessible components.
Motion/Micro-Interactions	Framer Motion	Implements the "vision of polish" with purposeful, subtle, and delightful animations.
Compute/Hosting	Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers	Zero-cost infrastructure, global CDN, and powerful serverless compute for APIs/backend logic.
Database & Auth	Supabase (PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth)	Highly scalable, managed PostgreSQL database, robust built-in user authentication.
File Storage	Supabase Storage	S3-compatible storage for all user-uploaded files (PDFs, images).
AI Backend	Google Gemini Models (1.5 Pro for tools)	GenAI backbone. Orchestrated via Genkit or Direct Fetch Calls (within Workers) for maximum control and performance.
Payment Gateway	Stripe	Integrated via Cloudflare Worker/Supabase Function for freemium monetization.
3. Core Features & Functional Workings
The app's functionality centers around a single, context-aware chat interface.
3.1 Conversational AI Core (The Central Hub)
Feature	Working Mechanism	UI/UX Standard
Chat Interface (/chat)	Main application entry point. Handles message state, history-aware API calls, and embedded output rendering.	Clean, minimal, 2-column layout. Left sidebar for history/nav. Input bar persistent at the bottom.
Context & History	The entire conversation history (alternating user and model messages) is retrieved from Supabase DB and passed with every new user query to the Gemini API call via the Next.js API route/Worker.	AI retains context across turns, eliminating the "broken memory" issue.
Input Modality	Accepts text input, PDF/Image Uploads (via file picker/drag-and-drop), and Voice Input (via Web Speech API).	Attached files appear as clean, dismissible "pills" above the input bar.
AI Persona Selector	Users select a persona (e.g., Teacher, Friend, Analyst) from a Supabase-backed list. The selected persona is injected as a System Instruction into the Gemini prompt for all responses.	Subtle visual cue (color change, badge) next to the AI avatar reflects the active persona.
Prompt Template Library	Modal accessed via + in the input bar. Displays predefined prompts (src/lib/prompts-data.ts) to start complex tasks.	Smoothly revealing modal. Templates populate the chat input field immediately upon click.
3.2 Integrated Study & Learning Tools
Feature	Working Mechanism	Output & Persistence
AI Note Summarizer	Triggered by prompt/template. Cloudflare Worker uses an image/PDF processor to extract text, which is then fed to a Genkit Tool.	Outputted as a distinct, scrollable card (with keywords as badges) embedded in the chat bubble. Saved to Supabase Database.
AI Flashcard Generator	Triggered by prompt/Smart Tool. Genkit Tool returns structured JSON of Q&A pairs from the chat context/notes.	Renders an interactive, flippable mini-card viewer directly in the chat. Saved to Supabase Database.
AI Quiz Generator	Triggered by prompt/Smart Tool. Genkit Tool returns structured JSON of multiple-choice questions, options, and answers.	Renders an interactive quiz interface within the chat bubble, providing immediate feedback and a final score summary. Saved to Supabase Database.
AI Study Planner	Triggered by prompt/template. Genkit Tool solicits user inputs (subjects, dates, hours) over a multi-turn sequence and returns the schedule as an HTML table.	Renders the schedule table embedded in the chat bubble. Saved to Supabase Database.
Smart Tools	A contextual toolbar that appears below AI messages. Includes one-click actions: "Rewrite Text," "Convert to Bullets," "Generate Counterarguments."	Triggers a dedicated Genkit Tool for text transformation, displaying the new output in a subsequent chat bubble.
Concept Memory & Side Notes	Users highlight text in any chat message and click "Add to Concept Notes."	Saved to a dedicated table in Supabase. Accessible via a smoothly animated slide-out panel from the right side of the screen. Includes search and tagging.
3.3 Progress, Gamification, & Dashboard
Feature	Working Mechanism	UI/UX Standard
User Dashboard (/dashboard)	Fetches aggregated user data from Supabase via server actions.	Central hub with personalized welcome. KPI cards display key metrics (Summaries Made, Quizzes Taken) with clear visual emphasis.
Progress Tracker	Users manually log study sessions (studySessions table) and set goals (goals table) via simple forms.	Dynamic Recharts bar graph visualizes "Goal vs. Logged" hours. Updates in real-time.
Gamification	Study Streaks calculated via server actions. Badges earned based on predefined activity thresholds.	Visually rewarding elements: prominent Streak counter (e.g., animated flame icon). Badges displayed with celebratory Framer Motion animations upon unlock.
4. UI/UX & Design Standards (The "Vibe" / Polish)
The design adheres strictly to the defined "Vision of Polish," ensuring a premium and intelligent user experience.
Standard	Requirement	Implementation Target
Aesthetic Theme	Professional Minimalism. Deep charcoal background with limited, purposeful use of color.	All base components follow the dark theme. Ample negative space to prevent clutter.
Color Palette	Strict Usage. Blue for information/active states (#3B82F6), Purple for primary action/premium status (#B788E6).	Primary CTAs (Send, Go Premium) are purple. Hover states use subtle blue/purple tints.
Typography Hierarchy	Satoshi (Headers), Inter (Body). Strict scale for weights and sizes.	Clear distinction between headings and body copy for quick scanning and readability.
Micro-Interactions	Purposeful Motion (Framer Motion). Motion must support clarity, not distract.	Message Entry: Slide-up and slight fade animation. AI Response: Smooth, readable "typing" effect. Component Reveal: Gentle slide-in/fade for menus and modals.
Spacing & Polish	Intuitive Harmony. Adhere to a strict 8px-based spacing scale. Consistent border-radius (e.g., rounded-lg).	No misaligned elements. Generous padding around chat bubbles and cards for breathability.
Output Presentation	Structured Content. Embedded content must be a primary focus.	Summaries/Quizzes/Flashcards are rendered as self-contained cards within the chat bubble, with their own internal padding and clear headers.
Flow & Guidance	No Dead-Ends. Always suggest the next logical step.	Contextual "Next Steps" buttons appear below key AI outputs (e.g., "Create Flashcards" after a summary).
5. Growth & Monetization Strategy
Strategy	Working Mechanism	Technical Implementation
Frictionless Entry	Clear CTA: "Start Free â€“ No Signup Needed." Initial usage is guest access only.	Allow anonymous interaction for a few turns. Prompt for Auth/Signup only upon attempting to save content or hit a usage limit.
Freemium Model	Free: Limited monthly usage (e.g., 5 summaries, 1 study plan). Premium: Unlimited usage, Google Calendar Sync, custom templates, advanced analytics (future).	Supabase DB: is_premium flag on user table. Usage metrics tracked daily/monthly. Cloudflare Worker (Scheduled): For monthly usage reset logic.
Public UGC SEO	Users can opt-in to "Share Publicly" for all generated content (Summaries, Quizzes, Plans).	Supabase DB: Separate public tables with RLS policies allowing read access. Next.js Dynamic Routes: /summaries/[slug] to serve content. Dynamic Metadata: For rich snippets and high search ranking.
SEO Blog System	Route: /blog. Content focused on low-KD, long-tail student queries (e.g., "AI study planner for CBSE 2025").	Hosted on Cloudflare Pages. Strong internal linking strategy to funnel organic traffic directly to the /chat interface.
