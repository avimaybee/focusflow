## 📋 Testing Instructions

1. **Clear cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Force Refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Open DevTools:** F12 → Network tab
3. **Filter:** Type `/api/chat` in search box
4. **Send a message:** Type test message and click Send
5. **Check results:**
   - Should see 1-2 GET requests (was 5-7)
   - Should see no "Scheduling retry" logs (was 5 retries)
   - Should see no flickering

## 🎯 Expected Console Output (After Fix)

**Should NOT see:**
```
[Client] loadMessages called {attempt: 0}
[Client] loadMessages called {attempt: 0}  ⚠️ TWICE
[Client] Scheduling retry for loadMessages (repeated)
[ChatPage] messages changed, length: 0 [] (cleared multiple times)
```

**Should see instead:**
```
[Client] Adding userMessage to messages
[Client] POST /api/chat responded
[Client] Adding model response to messages
[Client] messages length after model append: 2
```
